## 1. Website Conceptualization

### Mission Statement  

MindMate is our group project website that focuses mainly on **mental health**. The goal is pretty simple: give people an easy way to check in with their feelings, reflect, and build good habits over time. A lot of health apps are either too complicated or they only look at one thing, like fitness or meditation. We wanted to bring those ideas together in one space.  

The site will include tools like a daily mood tracker, journal notes, reminders, and even a breathing exercise for short breaks. It’s not about being perfect or competitive, but about consistency. By checking in daily and seeing patterns in their moods, users can become more aware of what helps them and what stresses them out.  

Our design approach is to keep everything calming. The interface will use soft colors, big buttons, and easy navigation so that the site feels supportive, not stressful. In short, MindMate is like a friendly digital buddy that nudges you to pause, reflect, and take care of yourself.
